The duplicate finder plugin ignores the following classpath elements by default unless the `useDefaultResourceIgnoreList` flag is set to `false`.

| Regular expression | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `^META-INF/.*`     | matches any resource inside a `META-INF` directory in the classpath hierarchy root. Jars store information in `META-INF` and some resources actually must be on the classpath multiple times (e.g. for the Java Service Provider facility). |
| `^OSGI-INF/.*`     | matches any resource inside an `OSGI-INF` directory in the classpath hierarchy root. OSGi components store their information in this directory. |
| `^licenses/.*`     | matches any resource inside a `licenses` directory in the classpath hierarchy root. This is a common place for storing component specific license resources which often have the same name. |
| `.*license(\.txt)?$` | matches any resource ending in `license` or `license.txt`. This is a common name for license resources which tend to get sprinkled all across dependencies. |
| `.*notice(\.txt)?$` | matches any resource ending in `notice` or `notice.txt`. This is a common name for resources (e.g. in Apache provided jars) which tend to get sprinkled all across dependencies. |
| `.*readme(\.txt)?$` | matches any resource ending in `readme` or `readme.txt`. This is a common name for component information which tend to get sprinkled all across dependencies. |
| `.*third-party(\.txt)?$` | matches any resource ending in `third-party` or `third-party.txt`. This is a common name for resources (e.g. in Apache provided jars) which tend to get sprinkled all across dependencies. |
| `.*package\.html$` | matches any resource ending in `package.html`. The old name of `package-info.java` which tend to get sprinkled across jars and then clash if a package is populated from multiple jars. |
| `.*overview\.html$` | matches any resource ending in `overview.html`. This is a common name for documentation which tend to get sprinkled all across dependencies. |

The duplicate finder plugin ignores the following classpath classes by default unless the `useDefaultClassIgnoreList` flag is set to `false`.
| Regular expression | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `^.*\$/.*`     | matches Java Inner Classes |

The following local directory names will also always be ignored. Files in these directory are never checked or touched by the plugins:

| Regular expression | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `^.git$` | git SCM directory |
| `^.svn$` | Subversion SCM directory |
| `^.hg$` | Mercurial SCM directory |
| `^.bzr$` | Bazaar SCM directory |
